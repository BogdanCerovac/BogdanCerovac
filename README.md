> If not for others - be egoistic - do it for yourself - make it as accessible as possible. Some day you might appreciate it as well.

### Some facts about me:

- I’m currently working as front-end developer and web accessibility lead for [Vokser AS (new name for ItumX AS)](https://www.vokser.no) but this is my private repo.
- I'm also a sole enterpreneur / independant consultant behind [IDEA lab (Inclusion Diversity Equity and Accessibility)](https://idea-lab.no/?s=github-profile).
- I'm volunteering as Head of the expert council at [The Institute for Digital Accessibility A11Y.si (in Slovenian)](https://www.digitalnadostopnost.si/o-nas/ekipa/),
- I’m trying to be a better team player, student, teacher, lecturer and mentor teaching people around me about accessibility, front-end, SEO and all that has to do with the web.
- I'm trying to learn more about disabilities and accessibility, both very wide and deep subjects at the same time - with a goal to make digital products that work for as much people as possible.
- I’m always learning more about web technologies in general as the changes and advancement in the field does not sleep and I ❤ WEB & I would ❤ A11y will be more embraced, respected and integrated in the future.
- I also like to think and [blog on accessibility, from theoretical to practical aspects of it](https://cerovac.com/a11y/).
- I’m [Web Accessibility Specialist](https://www.credly.com/badges/a95ae4c2-04c3-4c43-9ca2-cfa3e9c676f1/) certified by the [International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP)](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/wascertificants).
- I was a [Mobile Web Specialist certified by Google](https://www.credential.net/c3t3qcsz?key=8e1a90868c73bd81c2c575a02cdc7a0e45db7bb3ea43e048183c8d709bef4aa0) but they discontinued the certification (it was a true hands-on coding exam with real world problems that had to be solved by coding in 4 hours frame, so not your typical A/B/C/D multiple choices lottery).
- I stil like to play - I used to play a lot of Sid Meier's Civilization (TM), but now I love to play with GenAI, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, Augmented and Virtual reality and sometimes even with some Arduinos, Particles, NodeMCU's and ATTiny85's.
